# A Simple traffic light simulation  using C#
### Design to
- The form should have three buttons: Start, Stop, Reset.
-  Use three PictureBox components or panels to represent red, yellow, and green lights.
- The lights should change colors cyclically every 1 seconds when started.
- Create a Moving object associated with traffic light.
